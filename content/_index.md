#### What's a foldl?

Also known as reduce or accumulate, **folds** are a family of a higher-order function that traverse a data structure and "compresses" it into a new value. `foldl` is the left fold function, which works from the left-hand side of the data structure towards the right, accumulating a result as it goes. Every programmer is familiar with in-order traversal of an array - which is a left or right fold, depending on the direction traversed - but folds apply to _any_ recursive data structure, of which arrays (well, really linked lists) are a special case.

As for this website, it's where I host my writing about programming and management.
