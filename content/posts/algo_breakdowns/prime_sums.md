I discovered Project Euler years ago, then promptly forgot about it until recently.
After diving back in and rediscovering the joy of solving their problems, its time to break a few problems down.
In this post, I'll walk through problem 50 *Consecutive prime sums*.

The question asks us to find the prime, below one million, that can be written as the sum of the most consecutive primes.
The "sum of consecutive primes" refers to laying out primes in ascending order, then creating a sequence like `2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13 = 41`.
