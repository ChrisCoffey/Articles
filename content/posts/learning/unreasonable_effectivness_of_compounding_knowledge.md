Compound knowledge acquisition isn't a new topic, but it is worth reiterating how powerful a tool this is.
This post demonstrates the power of compounding in a contrived example, then lays out the basics you'll need to apply this to your own life.

##### Compounding, briefly

Learning occurs whenever we're confronted with novelty.
At first we try to pattern match the new events against our existing knowledge and mental models, and if they remain sufficiently novel, we learn something new.
That new information _may_ end up associated with whatever its most closely associated with, although it could also end up as an isolated fact floating around.
And while isolated facts can be fun, unless you're trying to win a trivia game, they're unlikely to be much help during day-to-day life.
Knowledge in isolation doesn't augment or extend our existing mental models.
If your brain is a bank account of knowledge, this is equivalent to adding some fixed amount of knowledge to it.

When new information augments or extends an existing mental model, something remarkably different happens.
Suddenly, everything associated with what you previously knew is able to leverage this new information as well.
Multiple mental models may adjust and shift to accommodate the new information.
This often provides new connections and insights to previously intractable problems.
To reuse the bank account analogy, this is closer to earning interest.

Repeat that process for 100 days in each case, starting from the same point.
In the first case you have 100 isolated facts for a total increase in knowledge of 100.
This is linear growth: `100 x k`.
In the second case however, let's say that each bit of information creates a `%0.1` increase across everything you know, plus there's the fact itself.
After 100 days, you'll end up approximately 10% more knowledgeable than when you started!
This is exponential growth: `(1+.01)^100`.

That is a remarkable difference.
100 facts, versus a 10% overall increase in knowledge.

##### Applying this in your life

If you're not already familiar with the practice of applying compounding knowledge growth, figuring out how to apply this to your life is daunting.
Considering that compounding is a function of time more than anything else, it shouldn't come as a surprise that showing up and doing some work is the most important part of knowledge compounding.
It's hard to make the time each and every day to read, write, and stretch your brain.
But it is because of how difficult these activities are to consistently do that they pay such outsize rewards.

Several years ago when I was becoming more serious about becoming an engineering manager I found myself struggling to understand the dimensions of the new role.
I work at a small company without anyone in-house who could mentor me through the transition, so I turned to books.
Unfortunately, at the time my son was just learning to walk and free-time at home was hard to find.
I tried to fit learning into my life piecemeal by reading or writing whenever I had a spare moment.
Needless to say, I wasn't progressing as quickly as I aspired to.

Then I experimented with audiobooks instead of my beloved paper books.
I was living about 2 miles from my office at the time, which made for a pleasant 40 minute walk each way.
Suddenly, by a small tweak from paper to audio books I had unlocked 80 minutes of focused time where I could listen and absorb information from experts.
This realization and practice was a revelation for me.

I'm not suggesting that you could leverage the exact technique I did, but I think its worth taking note of how powerful consistent focused time can be.
By transitioning from reading here and there when I had time to getting in 80 minutes a day, I switched from taking 6 weeks per-book to ~7 days.
For more on the power of consistent focus and finding time, I suggest reading _"Deep Work"_ by Cal Newport.

And of almost equal importance, the books I was listening to during my daily walks were all generally related to each other.
Often I would choose the next book based on the ones referenced multiple times in the past 2-3 books I'd listened to.
In this manner, I was not only consistently accumulating knowledge, but I was adding that knowledge to my existing mental models.
Compounding it if you will.

To put it as succinctly as I can, in my experience the two things you need to address in order to start compounding knowledge are:
1. Consistent and regular learning.
2. Focusing your efforts in a single direction.
