A lot has already been written about compounding knowledge (links here), so in this post you'll receive a quick refresher on how compounding works, then learn how to maximize your learning.

##### Compounding in-brief

Learning occurs whenever we're confronted with novelty.
At first we try to pattern match the new events against our existing knowledge and mental models, and if they remain sufficiently novel we'll learn something new.
That new information _may_ end up associated with whatever its most closely associated with, although it could also end up as an isolated fact floating around.
It's that small difference between hanging new knowledge off of existing knowledge vs. isolating it that leads to the difference between linear and exponential growth.

As a reminder, linear growth is when you have a line defined by `y = mx + b`.
`m` is how much the line increases for each unit of `x`, and `b` is the starting quantity.
Thinking about knowledge as the quantity, in linear growth each new fact you learn does not build upon what you already know.
Let's assume you still learn the fact and can recall it easily, but because it is disconnected from any of your other knowledge, it remains just a single point of information.
Over time, as you accumulate more and more isolated facts, your total knowledge increases as a function of `fact x time`, which is equivalent to just adding up all of the facts you've learned.
In other words, if what you're learning starts and remains isolated, each new bit of knowledge cannot increase the value or utility of any previously learned facts.

Compounding is an exponential curve given by each new addition increases

- compounding as exponential growth created by each addition adding to what's already known
- Illustrate power of compounding with a simple example
  - Specifically the power of the number of periods. If you can inrease the periodicity of compounding, even a tiny growth rate has a huge impact

- How to integrate compounding knowledge into your life
  - Think about what you've been learning. Do you:
    - Read every day?
    - Experiment with something new (new tool, problem, etc...) frequently?
    - Share what you've learned with others? Even a 4-year old counts!
