Welcome to my README!
I was first introduced to manager readmes by Ian Marlier.
The idea - in case you haven't encountered one before - is to give you an overview of who I am as a manager and how to work with me effectively.

### Operating Approach

- I hold weekly 1:1s with my direct reports and generally bi-weekly 1:1s with the folks I work closely with who are outside my reporting structure.
    I keep notes during each 1:1 to help track our progress, so don't be alarmed if you see me scribbling in my notebook or typing away.
- I like to hold bi-weekly team "catchups" with all of my directs as an opportunity for everyone to share what's going well/needs additional focus.
    These are also a great plae for general knowledge sharing.
- Even if the company conducts reviews annually, I'll provide each of my directs with a semi-annual performance review.
    Reviews explain how my directs have been performing against expectations and two behaviors they can adopt/improve to increase their positive impact.
