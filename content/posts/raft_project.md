Talk through why I'm interested in Raft:
* Cool algorithm
* Like distributed systems
* Lack of a simple off-the-shelf Haskell implementation

Goals:
* Easy to use
* Heavy Compiler verification
* Minimal user API
* Fast
* Correct

Basic approach:


Intro to the Raft articles:
* What are the basics of Raft. This is a rehash of the first 5-6 pages of the paper, but without all of the Paxos commentary
* Deeper dives into the key aspects of the algorithm
* Overview of the library
