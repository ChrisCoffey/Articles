Over the past month or two I've had several conversations with teammates where they've asked for my "reading list".
I read a lot, but there isn't anything particularly special about the books I read.
That being said, books are wonderful and always worth sharing, so here are the things I've read that have made a big impact on me.
They're mostly professional, but there are a few mind-expanding books thrown in for good measure.
