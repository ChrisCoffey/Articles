# Developing your remote employees

This article is about managing remote workers, particularly how to continue investing in and developing your remote employees.
I've been managing remote engineering teams for a few years now, and while I'm not expert, I've figured a few things out that are worth sharing.

### Why I'm talking about this now

The COVID-19 pandemic has forcibly introduced the entire world to remote work.
Not everyone is fortunate enough to be able to work remotely, but for most [knowledge workers](link to Drucker's definition), this is their first time working remotely.
I'm defining working remotely as spending over 50% of your time outside a traditional office, so the odd work-from-home day does not count.

Creating millions of remote workers overnight put an immediate strain on the IT infrastructure and day-to-day logistics for most companies.
Those are the short-term consequences, but there are difficult medium and long-term effects of remot work that folks will start experiencing as people continue working from home.

In my short time as a remote manager, I've needed to rapidly scale my organization.
I've been forced to layoff 60% of my reports and peers.
I've coached people out of the company, and coached people into promotions.
Almost entirely remotely.

I'm not going to talk about how to actually get your day-to-day work done, that's table stakes for this material (although I will write a followup article about how to effectively get stuff done remotely).
At the end of the day, while I'm constantly improving, I think I have something to share with all of the newly-minted remote managers out there.

### Developing your team remotely

Managing people is hard.
Remote work is hard.
Therefore, managing remote workers should be even more difficult than either managing people or working remotely, right?

Wrong.
But also not wrong.
Managing remote workers isn't necessarily more or less difficult than managing in-person teams, its simply different.

I use the rest of this essay to advocate for effective remote team development tactics.
I've broken team development down into five sections.
I recommend reading through the sections in order, or at least reading "Healthy remote relationships" first.

1. Healthy remote relationships
2. Guardrails for remote success
3. Providing feedback from home
4. Grabbing a socially-distant coffee
5. Building positive feedback loops

#### Healthy remote relationships

#Its not just about trust, its also about the random exchange of information that's so valuable. Work this in?
Its probably impossible to have a consistently high-output team where the members don't trust each other.
Trust, and the psychological safety that comes with it, take time and shared experiences to create.
When everyone is working in the same space, the kind of small daily interactions that occur in kitches and hallways help grow trust.
We've all probably had that 3-minute "hello" in the kitchen turn into an important troubleshooting or brainstorming session with one of our directs.
Over weeks and months, these random (positive) encounters help create a sense of trust.

So how to recreate those interactions in a heterogeneous environment, or even a remote-only setting?
First, think through the important aspects.
These are synchronous conversations, meaning they're an conversation with both parties actively engaged in it, not an email/slack exchange.
Next, the best ones usually happen when a few people from different teams are togeather and someone asks "What are you working on these days?".
The key parts are _synchronous_, _random group_, and _unstructured_ conversations.
Recreating those is difficult, but very possible.
# Donut pitch?

Also critical to overcommunicate, but in ways that minimze burden on your directs.
Become ruthless about what should be synchronous, and cut as much out as possible.
Your directs lives are just as busy as your own, so the more you can let them do on their own pace, the better.
# Annecdote about proposal review
Option 1) review the proposal live in a meeting
Optoin 2) send out the proposal, and ask to have a meeting at the end of the following day
Option 3) Create a more formal "proposal review process". See holocratic decision making
^ Indicate that Option 2) works best for the vast majority of situations and teams. 3 is the most async, but requires very high engagement from the team to be effective

Finally, talk about how communication in general is more difficult and how you need to simply work harder to make sure not only that you're getting the "right" amount of human contact, but that each of your directs is as well.
Check in on them.
If someone seems a bit off, poke at it.
In order to do this, you need to have authentic relationships with your directs and care about how they're doing.
Its not easy, but its totally worth it.
The work you do to create healthy relationships provides the foundation for everything else you'll have to do to actually **improve** your team's productivity in a remote environment.


#### Guardrails for remote success

I learned about **guardrails** from a former colleague & mentor of mine.
He explained, and later showed, how to create situations that protect against an individuals weaknesses, while ideally letting them play to & further develop their strengths.
I'm not going to explain guardrails further in this article - they're worth of a separate article - but instead describe some of the key guardrails for a remote team.

Mangers for any team - whether in person or remote - should be measured not by their own contributions, not by their team's output, but by the outcomes that their team(s) create.
Outcomes are tricky to measure, so its important as a manager to prioritize defining the metrics & building the dashboards that allow you to observe your team's outputs - since that's all you can control.
Over time, you need to check that these outputs serve as leading indicators for the outcomes you need to achieve.
Once that's in place, it becomes a matter of improving what you measure, to paraphrase Peter Drucker.

-- Show my own team's growth as a visual?
A massive (but valuable) simplification of improving your team's outputs can be stated as; "increase the key output-per-direct on your team, then focus them on increasingly more valuable objectives".
So, how does this work differently in a remove vs. in-person environment?
The biggest difference is that the job description for everyone just shifted 10-20%.

We learn from a very young age how to work in-person alongside our peers.
Co-location is also one of the hallmarks of the modern university education system (for better or worse).
There's something to be said for sitting in the library at 10pm surrounded by hundreds of other people working just as hard as you.
That kind of "group work ethic" carries over to office environments where your colleagues are usually never more than a short walk away.

All that conditioning and training goes out the window as soon as people start working from home.
Your role as a manager for remote workers is to clearly explain what successful remote work looks like.
Remote work places different demands on people compared to in-person work, and its important that you show how this overlaps and changes their current responsibilities.
This means you resetting your entire organization's understanding for how work gets done, and what good vs. poor performance looks like.
Below I've included a short checklist of topics you should make sure to cover.

[ ] Which types of communication need to be synchronous?
[ ] Which types of communication should be asynchronous?
[ ] What is your video call ettiquite?
[ ] What is your public:private chat message expectation?
[ ] Are there specific times the work day "starts" at, and that you expect people to be present?
[ ] What is your team's chat response SLA? 10 minutes, 30 minutes?
[ ] How do you make sure the work/life boundary remains intact? People need to step away from work.

# Link to and publish our own remote work good/bad breakdown

# annecdote about times I've completely missed a meeting because of phone issuse
# annecdote about internet dropping/ making video call infeasible
# annecdote about burnout, overworking, and underworking. Pain from sitting down more at home than in the office.

Goal is to establish a framework for your directs to be successful, but also for them to build on their successes.
Second part is the development plan, about which a lot has been written elsewhere.

#### Feedback from the comfort of your own home

Feedback as the tool that drives improvement.
Needs to be constant & effective.
Effective is: #define effective here

Task relevant & behavioral feedback.
Task relevant is soft-realtime, behavioral can be more batch-processing so long as you provide specific examples.
How to deliver realtime feedback to someone about a presentation when it was over video call?  This is the dilemma re. hallway vs. catch on chat.
 Walk through story about Abby & the "no-prep presentation". Point out how important it was to have given the feedback over video call

Point out that chat can easily be misconstrued or misunderstood.
Employee who had been fired before after a "can we chat when you have a sec" message. Ominous undertones I was never aware of
Importance, like everything with feedback, of being **very** specific


Importance of task-relevant feedback

#### Grabbing a socially-distant coffee: mentorship

Mentoring is hard IRL, even more difficult in many cases when remote.
How to provide resources beyond yourself to your team?
Get creative, consider that mentorship is a great way to talk & think through problems, but doesn't need to be in-person (although that's best).
Consider recorded talks/ books/ podcasts that shed a new light on the problem your direct is facing.
Put them in touch with people in your network for a quick chat on the phone (can be easier than an email exchange due to the shorter life of engagement).
The key is not to solve their problem for them, but put them in contact with resources that can shed some light on what they're struggling with. Best case they solve things themselves.

#### Building positive feedback loops

You all trust each other.
You've defined success.
You're providing constant feedback.
You're giving them the resources to learn & level up their thinking/skills.
Now tie it all together & create some feedback loops.

Learning requires feedback (find paper to cite here).
You're trying to help your directs learn, so you need to create feedback loops.
Ideally ones you don't need to drive, but that your team culture/tooling can support.
metrics dashboards & bi-weekly reviews.
Reinforce positive examples of the behavior/skills you want to see.
Don't publicly chastise/shame people, that breaks trust and the feedback loop.


#### Wrapping up

Hitting these notes is a lot of work.
But remember, for all the friction remote communication creates, you also get far more control over your think-time.
Nobody can bother you unless **you want them to** (close chat apps and email), etc...
Also, better visiblity into what all of your teams/ directs are doing because most communication should be in writing. This lets you catch up on your time, and to greater depth.
Most importantly, if you're struggling to adapt, talk about it with your directs let them know what you're trying to improve. Get their feedback, you might be surprised.



--- NOTES ---


For example, giving feedback in-person is both easier and more difficult.
Its much easier to speak with someone for 3 minutes after they give a poor presentation and point out an area of improvement.
This kind of thing is informal, and often happens on the way back to your respective desks after everyone left the conference room together.
Doing the same thing remotely means you need to either a) announce to **everyone** on the video conference that you want to speak with Bob after the meeting, or b) sending them a chat message/ email/ calendar invite to talk about the presentation.
Option a) is a non-starter for me because all of the attendees are now aware that you want to talk with Bob, and most of us aren't good enough actors to hide when we're disappointed.
That leaves sending some type of asynchronous message and hoping that Bob sees & responds to it quickly enough that he doesn't context switch away from the presentation.
This happens all the time for me, and it reduces the effectiveness of my feedback as more and more time passes.
If the entire day passes without having a chance to meet with Bob, the coaching window closes.

On the other hand, giving difficult feedback remotely can be easier over a video call.
I'm sure we've all unconsciously softened corrective feedback for one of our directs when their body language indicates they're deeply uncomfortable.
Its human nature, but its also a great way to create miscommunication.
You go into the conversation needing to tell Alice that she needs to provide twice as much context in her memos.
But as you list a few specific examples, Alice's visible discomfort becomes your discomfort and you soften the message.
Alice doe not double the context in her memos.
Video calls, because they convey only a fraction of the information we get from in-person conversations, actually reduce the degree to which I soften my corrective feedback.
More often than not, this results in Alice delivering what I've asked of her.

Feedback

KILL THE BAD SENTENCES
EDIT PASS COUNT: 0 (must hit 10)

- focusing only on development and coaching with this article
    - Include Andy Grove quote about training
    - point out that my success is determined by the success & outputs of my reports
    - end with question about how to continue making them better when everyone is remote

- Work through things in order of importance
1) Make sure they know what success looks like
    - In their role at the company
        - What quality and quantity of output are required
    - As remote workers
        - Link to a post about good remote worker and bad remote worker
    - As part of the larger company community
    - As members of their own families/communities
2) Feedback
    - Giving
        - Behavioral
        - task-relevant
            - is it okay that they were posting in a company chat during that meeting about foo?
        - Communication is much harder overall when remote
            - Writing
    - Getting
        - Sometimes easier to get difficult feedback from people in remote settings
3) Charting career growth plans
    - Again, communication around what they really want
    - Keeping track of their progress against the goals
    - Formal training opportunities
    - mentorship
        - Again communication is hard, so how to break this up a little bit?

-- personal anecdotes about something that was difficult
    - in a 1:1, video cutting out all the time
    - Telling someone they did an unsatisfactory job over chat instead of on a call
    - Not being able to catch someone to give them feedback after a presentation
    - role-power becomes more pronounced, easier for quiet folks to hide in shadows
    - Written communication making it easier to understand what they're working on and provide positive/corrective feedback
