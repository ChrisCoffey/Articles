## What could go wrong?

I'm going to tell you a little story about how I added a new project to my team's workload and how we managed to actually get it done without collapsing under all of our other projects.

It was last Tuesday, about 20 minutes before my weekly one-on-one with one of our VPs when Slack popped up an alert on my screen.
`I was just chatting with <your boss> and we was going to go back to you guys to see if maybe a script could be run to do the <work> in some type of automated fashion before next Wednesday` it read.
Moments later I'd fired off a response letting her know that one of my engineering teams could take care of the work.
What did I just do??!
I'd accepted a project directly from an exec rather than going through my PM, and via Slack no less.

These days there are three small teams reporting to me, and one of them was the perfect fit for this work.
They had a fairly low level of task-relevant maturity, so required significant oversight and guidance frome me, since I didn't have confidence the work could be completely delegated to them.
As a result, despite the small size of the project, accepting it had some pretty nasty second-order effects.
First, it committed several hours of my time to organizing and assisting with this work.
Those were hours that I had previously allocated to spend on some strategic work, so in accepting the project I deprioritized the strategic work.
Additionally, the new project had a similar "priority bump" impact on the selected team's workload.
They were in the midst of some cleanup work for a recently released project, but that now had to be deferred until the new project wrapped.

This idea that accepting new work has an impact on the delivery speed for all other project work is nothing new.
It has been talked about for the past 60-70 years in the Lean Manufacturing movement, and more recently popularized for tech by the "Phoenix Project".
Personally, I've been aware of the impact that unplanned work & new projets can have for several years, and I try to structure my teams workloads accordingly.
Pulling inspiration from the operations research sub-discipine queueing theory, its possible to minimize the impact of this unplanned work by building in some excess capacity.
Reserving excess capacity, say 15% of the team's time, in theory should cap their utilization at 85%.
In reality they team will be busy working on internal work/ overflow in that 15%, but by preventing them from committing to their full capacity we're able to prevent the exponential wait times predicted by queuing theory (and that we've all see happen in the real world).

TODO write up a brief description of how the queueing theory match works!

## Overcomitting in spite of it all
At this point hopefully you're asking why, given that I'm aware that full utilization leads to exponential delivery delays, did I accept a new project for one of my teams?
That's a great question that gets into the second part of what I'd like to talk about, the planning falacy and how easy it is to say yes.
Fundamentally, saying yes feels good.
You're agreeing to help someone with their problem, so there's an increase in status for you, plus you know that you've made someone happy.
There's a dark side to saying yes though.
As anyone who's oversubscribed themselves can acknowledge, overcommitting leads to some seriously high stress levels and missed commitments.

The stress is simply a function of there only being `x` hours in the day (hopefully `x` <= 8).
For those of us in knowledge work
