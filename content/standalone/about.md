I'm a programmer fascinated by typed functional programming. I also happen to be a father, rock climber, and engineering manager at a startup. I've been working in tech for 15 years in a number of roles. Along the way I've made more mistakes than I can remember, built some exciting products, and learned a few things.

Writing helps me think, and this blog is a tool for exploring questions I find interesting. Hopefully you'll find some value in these posts too.
