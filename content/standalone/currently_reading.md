I love to read! I also have a "bad" habit of reading four or five books at a time.

If you're ever curious what I'm currently reading, this is an up-to-date record of the half-finished books scattered around my home.

#### Make it Clear
A collection of bite-sized chapters about effective communication from a long-time MIT professor. Thus far it's been excellent, although much of the content focuses on presentations which are not relevant to me right now.

#### Functional Domain Design
I'm working through this as part of a book club with a colleague. It purports to be a practical guide to software architecture, from a functional perspective

#### Left Hand of Darkness
Apparently one of Ursula K. Le Guin's best books, so I'm excited to give it a read
