I love to read! I also have a "bad" habit of reading four or five books at a time.

If you're ever curious what I'm currently reading, this is an up-to-date record of the half-finished books scattered around my home.

#### The 4 Disciplines of Execution
About five years ago I had a very bad experience with Wildly Important Goals (WIGs). It wasn't until earlier this year that I learned of this book by McChesney, Covey, and Hurling. I grabbed a copy largely because they convinced Clayton Christensen to write the forward for it, although I'm also curious how far my own experience with WIGs diverges from the prescription.

#### Designing Data Intensive Applications
I'm working through this as part of a book club with a colleague. I started reading the PDF version, but I can't get through ebooks on a laptop/monitor so I ended up grabbing the paper copy. I'm a big fan of databases, and thus far I've been impressed by how much depth this book brings.

#### Writing to Learn
William Zissner's book arguing that writing and thinking are one in the same. I enjoy his writing, and the argument isn't half bad either.
