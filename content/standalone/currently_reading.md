I love to read! I also have a "bad" habit of reading four or five books at a time.

If you're ever curious what I'm currently reading, this is an up-to-date record of the half-finished books scattered around my home.

#### The 4 Disciplines of Execution
About five years ago I had a very bad experience with Wildly Important Goals (WIGs). It wasn't until earlier this year that I learned of this book by McChesney, Covey, and Hurling. I grabbed a copy largely because they convinced Clayton Christensen to write the forward for it, although I'm also curious how far my own experience with WIGs diverges from the prescription.

#### Designing Data Intensive Applications
I'm working through this as part of a book club with a colleague. I started reading the PDF version, but I can't get through ebooks on a laptop/monitor so I ended up grabbing the paper copy. I'm a big fan of databases, and thus far I've been impressed by how much depth this book brings.

#### Ringworld
I love sci-fi of all kinds, but particularly hard sci-fi. Ringworld is a classic I recently received as a gift.

#### Linear Algebra and its Applications
I'm not sure its fair to say one's _reading_ a maths textbook, but I've been working through this classic introductory linear algebra text. I have a liberal arts education and unfortunately there are some large gaps in my basic mathematical skills. So, I borrowed this from my brother.

#### Web Application Scalability for Startup Engineers
This one is an in-depth re-read of something I skimmed through several years ago. The re-read is also part of a book club with a colleague. Although this book is rather high-level, we're taking it slowly.
